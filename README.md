 Chillin-Bites - Food Delivery Application

A full-stack food delivery web application built with **React (Vite), Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
Users can browse food items, add them to a cart, place orders, and manage their accounts.  
Admins can manage food items, track orders, and update order statuses.  

This project demonstrates a modern **MERN stack application** with RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, Stripe integration, and a responsive frontend.
